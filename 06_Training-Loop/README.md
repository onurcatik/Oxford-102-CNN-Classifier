# Writing the Training Loop for a CNN Classifier

In this tutorial, we will delve into writing the training loop for a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier designed to classify flower images. This tutorial assumes prior knowledge of PyTorch and basic concepts in deep learning. We'll follow along with the transcript provided to guide our implementation step by step.

### Step 1: Writing the Training Loop

#### Import Necessary Libraries

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import transforms, datasets
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
```

#### Define Model

- Assuming the model class is already defined as mentioned in the transcript.

#### Define Hyperparameters and Device

- Ensure you have already defined hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, etc., and set the device (CPU or GPU) accordingly.

#### Load Dataset and Create Data Loaders

- Assuming you have already prepared the dataset and created data loaders as mentioned in the transcript.

```python
# Assuming you have created train_loader and test_loader
```

#### Writing the Training Loop

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    running_loss = 0.0
    for index, (inputs, labels) in enumerate(train_loader):
        # Send data to device
        inputs, labels = inputs.to(device), labels.to(device)

        # Forward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
  
        # Calculate loss
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        running_loss += loss.item()

        # Backward pass
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Print epoch loss
    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {running_loss / len(train_loader)}")
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Sending Data to Device**: Transfer input data and labels to the specified device (GPU or CPU).
2. **Forward Pass**: Perform forward propagation through the model to get predictions.
3. **Calculate Loss**: Compute the loss between the predicted outputs and the actual labels.
4. **Backward Pass**: Perform backpropagation to compute gradients and update model parameters.
5. **Print Epoch Loss**: Print the average loss for the current epoch.

### Step 4: Evaluation and Further Steps

Once the training loop is implemented, it's essential to evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation or test set using metrics like accuracy. Additionally, you can enhance the training loop by adding features like progress bars or monitoring training progress more closely, as mentioned in the transcript.
