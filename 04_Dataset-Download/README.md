# Downloading and Visualizing the Dataset

In this part, we're going to focus on the data part. We'll download the dataset, visualize it, and discuss the importance of this visualization in creating a strategy for preprocessing the images before introducing them to our model. Visualizing the data helps us understand its characteristics and decide on transformations needed for effective model training.

## Downloading the Dataset

The location of the dataset is specified in the notebook, along with the labels. By clicking on the provided link, you can download the dataset in zip format. There are 8189 images of 102 different classes of flowers. If you're using a local machine, simply introduce the dataset to your model. For Google Colab users, like myself, I've uploaded the dataset from my local drive to Google Drive. Now, let's write some code to mount Google Drive and access the dataset.

```python
from google.colab import drive

# Mount Google Drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## Data Visualization

First, let's define the paths to our data and labels. In this case, the images and labels are located in the same folder named "102 flowers".

```python
import os
import scipy.io as sio
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Define data and label paths
data_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/102 flowers/'
label_path = os.path.join(data_path, 'image_labels.mat')

# Load labels
labels = sio.loadmat(label_path)['labels'] - 1  # Convert to Python indexing
```

Next, let's visualize some sample images from the dataset. We'll generate random numbers to select images and display them.

```python
import random
from skimage import io as skio

# Generate random image numbers
image_num = random.sample(range(1, 8190), 8)

# Create subplots for visualization
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(8, 12))

for i in range(2):
    for j in range(4):
        # Generate image path
        image_path = os.path.join(data_path, f"image_{image_num[i*4 + j]:05d}.jpg")
  
        # Read and display image
        image = skio.imread(image_path)
        axes[i, j].imshow(image)
        axes[i, j].axis('off')
        axes[i, j].set_title(f"Label: {labels[image_num[i*4 + j]]}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Data Preprocessing Strategy

Visualizing the raw data helps us determine the necessary preprocessing steps. One observation is that not all images have the same dimensions. To address this, we can either crop the images to a standard size or scale them. Scaling ensures uniformity in dimensions but may distort the images slightly. In this case, scaling is preferred to preserve all information.

## Creating Metadata DataFrame

Finally, we need to create a metadata DataFrame containing image paths and labels for further processing.

```python
import glob

# Generate image paths
image_paths = sorted(glob.glob(os.path.join(data_path, '*.jpg')))

# Create metadata DataFrame
metadata = pd.DataFrame({'image_path': image_paths, 'label': labels.flatten()})
```
